I'm sad, I really want to cry and tell someone that I'm sad, but, I don't know who I can reach to.
I kinda jealous of people who know exactly who to reach when they're sad, someone who wants to hear and understand the sides of you that are less pretty and happy. 
But I think this kind of loneliness is totally normal in your early 2020, heard it a lot since 17.
